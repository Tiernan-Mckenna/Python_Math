# Celestial Mechanics

## Halley's Comet

In this project I will be looking at the mechanics of Halley's comet. I will look at solving this problem in 2 main ways, using the analytical and numerical approach using Newton's laws of Gravitation and Euler's methods. Secondly i will use the fourth order Runge Kutta method. 

### Outputs
- 2D plot of the Orbit after 1 year using the methods.
- 2D animation of the plot (GIF format) of 1 year of orbit
